    <h2>1. About Voriel</h2>
    <p>
        Voriel is a technology, advertising, and lead-generation platform that connects users with independent
        third-party
        contractors (“Service Providers”). Voriel does <strong>not</strong> perform home services, does
        <strong>not</strong>
        employ contractors, and does <strong>not</strong> guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of any services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Professional Services</h2>
    <p>
        Voriel is <strong>not</strong> a contractor, service provider, home improvement company, repair service, or
        cleaning
        provider. All services are performed exclusively by independent Service Providers, who operate on their own
        behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Screening or Verification</h2>
    <p>
        Voriel does <strong>not</strong> screen, background-check, license-verify, insurance-verify, endorse, or
        recommend
        any Service Provider. Any information displayed on the platform is provided directly by Service Providers and
        may not
        be verified.

        Voriel does not control and is not responsible for interactions, agreements, or disputes between users and
        Service Providers.

        <li>warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>your interactions or agreements with Service Providers,</li>
        <li>your failure to verify licensing, insurance, or qualifications.</li>
    </ul>
