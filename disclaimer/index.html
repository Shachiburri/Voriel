    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>
        This Disclaimer governs your use of the Voriel platform. By accessing or submitting information through Voriel,
        you
        acknowledge and accept this Disclaimer in full.
    </p>

    <h2>Platform Role</h2>
    <p>
        Voriel is a technology, marketing, and lead-generation platform. Voriel does <strong>not</strong> provide home
        services; does <strong>not</strong> perform repairs, installations, or labor; does <strong>not</strong>
        supervise,
        monitor, manage, or control Service Providers; and does <strong>not</strong> participate in any service
        transactions
        between users and independent contractors (“Service Providers”).
    </p>

    <h2>Independent Contractors</h2>
    <p>
        All Service Providers contacted through Voriel are independent third parties.
        They are <strong>not</strong> employees, agents, representatives, partners, subcontractors, or affiliates of
        Voriel.
        Any agreements, quotes, pricing, scheduling, or services occur solely between the user and the independent
        Service
        Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>No Screening, No Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
        Voriel does <strong>not</strong> endorse, recommend, screen, evaluate, background-check, license-verify,
        insurance-verify, or qualify any Service Provider in any way. Voriel makes <strong>no warranties</strong>,
        express
        or implied, regarding:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>quality, safety, or results of any service performed;</li>
        <li>qualifications, licensing, or insurance of any Service Provider;</li>
        <li>accuracy or reliability of information provided by Service Providers;</li>
        <li>conduct, behavior, punctuality, or legal compliance of Service Providers;</li>
        <li>property damage, injuries, theft, or negligence;</li>
        <li>any outcomes or results of services arranged through the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Users are solely responsible for performing all due diligence before hiring a Service Provider. This includes
        but is
        not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>verifying required licensing and insurance;</li>
        <li>checking qualifications and background;</li>
        <li>reviewing safety and compliance with local regulations;</li>
        <li>confirming pricing, scope of work, and agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Voriel disclaims all liability for any damages, losses, injuries,
        claims,
        misconduct, negligence, defects, delays, or issues of any kind resulting from services performed by a Service
        Provider. Any dispute or legal claim arising from a service must be resolved solely between the user and the
        Service
        Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
        By using the Voriel platform, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Voriel and its owners,
        operators,
        affiliates, and representatives from all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including
        attorney fees) arising from:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>services performed or not performed by a Service Provider;</li>
        <li>interactions, agreements, or disputes between you and a Service Provider;</li>
        <li>your failure to verify licensing, insurance, or qualifications;</li>
        <li>property damage, personal injury, misconduct, or unlawful activity by a Service Provider;</li>
        <li>your use or misuse of the Voriel platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This indemnification obligation applies to the maximum extent permitted by law and survives the use of the
        platform.
